/*
 * MQ-7 Carbon Monoxide Sensor PPM Reading Sketch
 *
 * This sketch reads the analog output from an MQ-7 CO sensor,
 * calibrates it, and converts the reading to Parts Per Million (PPM).
 *
 * Connections:
 * - MQ-7 AOUT pin -> Arduino A0 pin
 * - MQ-7 VCC pin -> Arduino 5V pin
 * - MQ-7 GND pin -> Arduino GND pin
 *
 * How it works:
 * 1. Calibration: The sensor first needs to be calibrated to find its
 * resistance in clean air (R0). This sketch does a quick calibration
 * in the setup() function. For best results, let the sensor warm up
 * for several minutes before running the calibration. The datasheet
 * recommends a 48-hour preheating period for maximum stability.
 *
 * 2. PPM Conversion: The sensor's resistance (Rs) changes in the presence
 * of CO. The ratio of Rs to R0 (Rs/R0) is used to calculate the PPM
 * concentration based on a formula derived from the sensor's datasheet graph.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This sensor is for educational and hobbyist purposes.
 * For any application where CO poses a health risk, use a certified and
 * professionally calibrated CO detector.
